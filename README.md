# Mailserver

## About this snap

This snap will setup all you need to run a mailserver of your own. This
snap will provision several LXD containers containing all software and
configuration.

## Requirements

You need to have the lxd snap installed on this host (`snap install lxd`).
Feel free to use any version.

## History

A few years back I moved away from Gmail to my self hosted solution and
I have been happy with the result. This snap is the second iteration of
that install. This install will probably be different compared to the
original one, but it is still based around my needs and what I think
a mail server should contain.
